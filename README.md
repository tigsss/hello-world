# hello-world
Just a place to keep track of potential projects for the future!

I am a beginner, but working hard to learn, and hopefully I will be able to handle more complex projects in the future.

I currently use Java and will try to learn Python and C++ in the future.

Project List:
Word Counter: Counts number of words, sentences, distinct words, and can also output a list of the most commonly used words in a text file
